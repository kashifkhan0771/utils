### Sort

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple and easy to understand, but not very efficient for large lists.

- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to the beginning (or end) of the list.

- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, efficient for small datasets.

- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together. It's very efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n).

- **Quick Sort**: Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around it. It's efficient with an average time complexity of O(n log n), but can be slow in the worst case.

- **Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap data structure to sort the array. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).
