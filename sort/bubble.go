package sort

// BubbleSort performs an in-place bubble sort on a slice of numeric values.
// It implements the bubble sort algorithm which repeatedly steps through the slice,
// compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
// Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) where n is the length of the slice
// Space Complexity: O(1) as it sorts in-place
